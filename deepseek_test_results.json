    "prompt": "solo traveler plans a camping trip to the Arctic somewhere in holiday during winter.",
    "expected_output": "Day 1-2: Fly to Tromsø, Norway, a gateway to the Arctic. Spend a day acclimating, renting cold-weather gear (thermal layers, insulated boots, a four-season tent), and joining a safety briefing. Stock up on high-calorie food and a portable stove. Day 3: Take a domestic flight or ferry to Svalbard (Longyearbyen), where solo travel outside settlements requires a rifle for polar bear protection—rent one locally or hire a guide. Day 4-6: Camp near Isfjorden, using snowshoes or skis to explore. Prioritize short daytime excursions (-20°C/-4°F temps), returning to camp before dark. Melt snow for water and sleep in a reinforced sleeping bag (-40°C rating). Day 7-8: Return to Longyearbyen for warmth, then fly back to Tromsø. Key tips: Check weather incessantly, carry emergency satellite communication (e.g., Garmin inReach), and inform others of your route. Only attempt this with prior winter survival experience—hypothermia and polar bears are real risks. Alternatively, join a guided expedition for safety. If you lack extreme cold-weather skills, this trip isn’t advisable—the Arctic winter is lethally unpredictable. Instead, consider guided tours or milder destinations like Finnish Lapland for solo aurora camping.",
    "actual_output_deepseek": "For a thrilling solo Arctic camping trip during winter, plan a 5-7 day adventure in Svalbard, Norway—a remote yet accessible destination with stunning icy landscapes. Fly into Longyearbyen, the world’s northernmost town, and join a guided expedition for safety, as polar bear encounters are possible. Pack extreme cold-weather gear (thermal layers, a -40°F sleeping bag, and insulated boots) and rent a sturdy four-season tent or stay in a heated expedition cabin. Spend days dog sledding, snowmobiling to glaciers, and chasing the northern lights at night. Prioritize safety with a satellite phone and local guides, and embrace the surreal beauty of the polar night."
