    "prompt": "solo traveler plans a camping trip to the Arctic somewhere in holiday during winter.",
    "expected_output": "Day 1-2: Fly to Tromsø, Norway, a gateway to the Arctic. Spend a day acclimating, renting cold-weather gear (thermal layers, insulated boots, a four-season tent), and joining a safety briefing. Stock up on high-calorie food and a portable stove. Day 3: Take a domestic flight or ferry to Svalbard (Longyearbyen), where solo travel outside settlements requires a rifle for polar bear protection—rent one locally or hire a guide. Day 4-6: Camp near Isfjorden, using snowshoes or skis to explore. Prioritize short daytime excursions (-20°C/-4°F temps), returning to camp before dark. Melt snow for water and sleep in a reinforced sleeping bag (-40°C rating). Day 7-8: Return to Longyearbyen for warmth, then fly back to Tromsø. Key tips: Check weather incessantly, carry emergency satellite communication (e.g., Garmin inReach), and inform others of your route. Only attempt this with prior winter survival experience—hypothermia and polar bears are real risks. Alternatively, join a guided expedition for safety. If you lack extreme cold-weather skills, this trip isn’t advisable—the Arctic winter is lethally unpredictable. Instead, consider guided tours or milder destinations like Finnish Lapland for solo aurora camping.",
    "actual_output_deepseek": "For a thrilling solo winter adventure, plan a 5-day Arctic camping trip in Svalbard, Norway, during December for a chance to see the Northern Lights. Fly into Longyearbyen, then join a guided expedition to a remote wilderness camp, where you’ll sleep in an insulated tent or a heated cabin. Spend your days dog sledding, snowmobiling across frozen fjords, and exploring ice caves, while nights are reserved for stargazing and aurora hunting. Pack extreme cold-weather gear, including thermal layers, a -40°F sleeping bag, and a reliable power bank for your camera. Prioritize safety by booking with a reputable tour operator experienced in polar conditions. This trip offers solitude, stark beauty, and the raw power of the Arctic winter.",
    "actual_output_gpt": "Embark on an extraordinary solo camping adventure in the Arctic this winter! Begin your journey by flying into the nearest accessible hub such as Tromsø, Norway or Longyearbyen, Svalbard, depending on your desired location.
